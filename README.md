# Home Price Prediction


A real estate price prediction model, using sklearn and linear regression. I covered various data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation. etc

**Libraries:** 
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

**data:** kaggle's home price dataset of Bangalore,Â India. I provided the data file `house_prices`

**Code:** provided in the `Predicting_Home_Prices.ipynb` notebook file

**Results:** Price of the house

**Accuracy:** Train_acc = 75%, Test_acc = 61%
